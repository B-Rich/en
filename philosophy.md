Scientific software and reproducibility
---------------------------------------
Software development is a critical part of science and deserves to be treated
as such.  Virtually all published science depends on numerous software tools.
I subscribe to the principles outlined in the 
[Science Code Manifesto](http://sciencecodemanifesto.org)
and the [Reproducible Research Standard](http://www.stanford.edu/~vcs/papers/LFRSR12012008.pdf).


To ensure the accuracy and reliability of computational scientific results,
it is essential that we strive for a standard of reproducibility.  To this
end, I make all code used in my papers [publicly](http://github.com/ketch)
[available](http://bitbucket.org/ketch).  Where reasonable,
I try to make the code well-documented and easy to use.

Scientific publishing and journal pricing
-----------------------------------------
I believe that publishing publicly-funded scientific research should not
be profit-motivated activity.  Charges for access to scientific publications
should be kept to a minimum.  I primarily publish my own work in relatively
inexpensive but highly respected journals run by non-profit professional 
societies ([SIAM](http://www.siam.org) and the [AMS](http://www.ams.org)).
I am a signatory to the [Cost of Knowledge](http://thecostofknowledge.com)
(Elsevier Boycott).  I do not support gold open access (i.e., author-pay) journals,
for reasons outlined here.
I place preprints of all my manuscripts on the [arXiv](http://www.arxiv.org)
when I submit them for publication.  Where allowed by the publisher, I put the
final version of my published papers on my site, downloadable from
[my publications page](/publications.html).

Open science
-------------
I'm a fan (not a guru) of open science.  Michael Nielsen's book "Reinventing
Discovery" was a real eye-opener for me.  I'm currently running a series of
[blog posts about specific open science practices](http://davidketcheson.info/tags.html#open-science) that I hope will be more
widely adopted.  My notebook on this site is intended to be an open lab
notebook.  I also contribute to open science by participating in the 
[Stack Exchange for Scientific Computing](http://scicomp.stackexchange.com).
