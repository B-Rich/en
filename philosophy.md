Scientific publishing and journal pricing
-----------------------------------------
I believe that publishing publicly-funded scientific research should not
be a for-profit activity.  Charges for access to scientific publications
should be kept to a minimum.  I primarily publish my own work in relatively
inexpensive but highly respected journals run by non-profit professional 
societies ([SIAM](http://www.siam.org) and the [AMS](http://www.ams.org).
I am a signatory to the [Cost of Knowledge](http://thecostofknowledge.com)
(Elsevier Boycott).  I do not support gold open access journals.  
I place preprints of all my manuscripts on the [arXiv](http://www.arxiv.org)
when I submit them for publication.
