This is a list of some of the tools that I use on a regular basis that have
come to be an essential part of my workflow.

 1. **LaTeX and BibTeX**.  Of course.
 1. [MacVim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/).  For writing code, math, and anything else.
    [My .vimrc](https://github.com/ketch/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc).
 1. [Mendeley](http://mendeley.com).  For managing references, socially.  I only use
    the desktop interface (never the website) and I always export to BibTeX.  
    Mendeley allows me to have bibliographic collections on particular
    topics that are automatically synchronized among all members of a group.
    Perfect for working with students and collaborators.
 1. [NValt](http://brettterpstra.com/nvalt-2-2-public-beta/).  For managing
    plain-text notes, which I use for everything.
 1. [Omnifocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/).  For managing tasks.
 1. [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).  For building this website.
 1. [Github](http://github.com).  For developing, storing, and synchronizing code.
 1. [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org).  For collaboratively writing papers,
    because they give you free private repositories (lots of them, if you're an
    academic.
 1. [Gitit](http://gitit.net/).  Wiki software that runs the KAUST Mathwiki, for
    internal collaboration within my group.
 1. [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com).  For finding papers.
