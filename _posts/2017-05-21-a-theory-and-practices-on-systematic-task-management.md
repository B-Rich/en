# A lifecycle model of productivity
As often observed, when we work on a subject, we usually experience the following productivity curve over time as plotted in the figure below.

{% include image.html img="/en/assets/img/productcurve.png" width="500px" title="A lifecycle curve of productivity over time." caption="Fig 1. Lifecycle curve of productivity level when working on a task over time." %}
</center>
The curve is the lifecycle on how working on the subject yields valuable outputs, which typically includes a slow and low-efficient starting phase, a rapid climbing phase, a flat peaking phase and a slow decaying phase.
In fact, this not only can be seen in task productivity but also occurs on almost everything in our daily lives, like people's activity level over ages, a fashion or a product profits and so on.

Now, imagine you have a bunch of subjects to work on over time and each of them has a similar lifecycle curve.
You can arrange when you start to work on your subjects, and your productivity working on the next subject might grow a little bit over time.

We consider two scenarios.
First, as shown in the figure on the left below, we continue working on new subjects before the previous subject's productivity level decays.

</td></tr></table>
*Fig 2. A continuous growth (A) and oscillations (B) of productivity levels over time. Dashed lines are the individual productivity lifecycle curves. Solid line is the sum of individual curves.*<br />
</center><br>

Obviously, the overall productivity curve experiences a non-decreasing growth over time as individual tasks' productivity curves overlap.

Next, we consider increasing the intervals between tasks so that the overlap between tasks is small.
We could find the productivity curve illustrated in Fig 2 (B) above.
