In <a href="http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k77982&amp;tabgroupid=icb.tabgroup143448">this succinct memo</a>, an advisory council at Harvard says that<br /><blockquote><em><span style="background-color: white;">major periodical subscriptions, especially to electronic journals</span>&nbsp;published by historically key providers, cannot be sustained: continuing these subscriptions on their current footing is financially untenable.</em></blockquote>It recommends the following course of action to the faculty:<br /><blockquote><em>&nbsp;If on the editorial board of a journal involved, determine if it can be published as open access material, or independently from publishers that practice pricing described above. If not, consider resigning.</em></blockquote><span class="Apple-style-span">It also specifies that "i</span><span class="Apple-style-span">t is untenable for contracts with at least two major providers to continue on the basis identical with past agreements.", but doesn't mention which two. &nbsp;Presumably they are a subset of {Springer, Elsevier, Wiley}.</span><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4660225022390848760-5504113796960647401?l=scienceinthesands.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
